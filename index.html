			<h1>Background</h1>
			<p style="padding-top:1em">With the start of America joining World War II, many African American families from the South were struggling economically. Before the war, African Americans located in the South were primarily in the agriculture industry, working mostly as sharecroppers. The sharecrop industry was extremely limited; many were unable to move up financially in that industry. With the economic turmoil that many families faced, they saw an opportunity to move to the North and West coast in order to become more financially stable. African Americans who moved to the West coast generally moved to California, more specifically the Bay Area. This caused a surge in population in the area.  The African American population in Oakland was approximately 8,500 in 1940 (the highest in the Bay Area) and grew to 47,500 by the beginning of 1950. The number of migrants outnumbered the number of residents by 4:1.

			<p> <span class="thesis">Question:</span> How did the increasing population of African American women in the Bay Area lead to positive social changes during the 1940s?
				<br>
				<br> <span class="thesis">Thesis:</span> Although racial tensions rose significantly due to this influx, the migration of African American families to the Bay Area in the 1940s led to an increase in feminism and the prominence of African American women. Specifically, African American women felt empowered with their rising socio-economic status and built coalitions to strengthen the African American community.

			<h1>Increasing Racial Tensions (Concession)</h1>
			<div class="attitude" style="width=1em;">
				<h2>Attitude Toward Black Migrants</h2>
				<p>
					The attitude towards the African Americans were very negative in the 1940s. A majority of the of the white residents saw them as guests that would return to the South after the war and hoped their culture would go back with them. The residents would often use terms like “unassimilable” and “undesirable guests” (These two actual terms have been altered due to their explicitness). African Americans were seen as a danger to society and the very community they had put significant effort in making. Specifically, white women would often target African American women with verbal attacks. Residents would create falsehoods about their laziness and incompetence. For example, Lacey Grey was just one victim of many who experienced poor treatment. When she arrived at work, Lacey noticed that all of her white co-workers giving her nasty glares. She did think much of it until somebody uttered a racial slur. She asked one of her friends what was going on. Someone had spread a rumor that Lacey had been cheating with the co-worker’s husband in order to get her fired. This example, and countless other incidents, occurred frequently, fueling the racism fire in the community.

				<h2>Discrimination</h2>
				<p>Heavy discrimination quickly followed the negative attitude towards African American migrants. A report by the Oakland Institute on Human Relations looked into racial discrimination as more black migrants moved into the Bay Area. They found that white property owners and real estate agents contractually required tenants and owners to prohibit them from renting or selling to African Americans in certain areas. The report stated that many white owners refused to serve African American customers. They also found high levels of employment discrimination. Employers hired white people before African Americans, especially in the defense industry, even though they were equally qualified. Economically, welder trainers and laborers ranked in the lowest paying categories.  A study done by the Department of Labor found that 63% of African American women were in this category, compared to 12% of white women.

			<h1>Empowering Socio-economically</h1>
			<div class="independence">
				<h2>Independence</h2>
				<p style="width:70em;">With the new opportunities presented to the African American women, many felt more independent and emotionally stronger. For example, Opal Smith moved with her husband and children to the Bay Area from Texas in 1943. Her husband got a job in the shipyards and made just enough to support the family. As Christmas was coming up, Opal wanted to get a temporary job in order to buy presents and a tree for the family. Her husband was reluctant at first but eventually gave in. After Christmas, she refused to quit her job since she enjoyed the feeling of independence. Another example is Henrietta Bolden; she moved to California with her husband after being employed as a domestic servant in Oklahoma. When she moved out to Oakland, she got a job in the shipyards, but after six months her husband wanted to move back to Oklahoma. Henrietta moved back with her with husband but could not deal with her previous job; she eventually moved back to California to work in the shipyards by herself.  These two examples are representative of the growing independence of African American women.

			<div class="households">
				<h2>Contribution to the Household</h2>
				<p> While enjoying the increased independence gained from the opportunities in the Bay Area, African American women also felt more empowered by transitioning from being homemakers to contributing to the household financially. Although they were at the bottom of working force, they found that the combination of being employed, homemakers, church women, and community workers were important elements in defining their self-identity. The average salary for African American women increased by 3 times from 1939 to 1949, increasing from $331.32 to $992.35. By contributing to the financial well-being of the household, African American women felt even more empowered. Their husbands’ stresses about finances were eased. The children were grateful for the better lives that they could have.  All in all, this resulted in general positivity for African American families.

			<h1>Strengthening the African American Community</h1>
			<div class="together">
				<img src="img/Infastructure.jpg" style="float: right; height: 20%; width:33%; margin-left:5em; ">
				<h2>Working Together</h2>
				<p>With everything African American women had to do, they needed some assistance with all the tasks they had at hand. Seeing each other struggle, they decided to step up and help others out. They would share child care; help each other with laundry; and exchange information about employment, housing, and social services. This allowed them to become more interdependent with each other and build a stronger sense of community. With the small amount of housing available to African American migrants, new migrants found housing accommodations with those who had moved to the Bay Area before. For example, June Williams and her husband came to Oakland in 1942 from St. Louis. They moved in with her cousin temporarily until they could a place to stay. After searching for a while, she eventually found an older African American woman who had an open room and said that they could stay for as long as they needed to. This is just one example of many that further strengthened the African American community.

				<h2>Building Infastructure</h2>
				<p> White residents utilized restrictive covenants to force African American families to move into the most underdeveloped areas in the Bay Area. These neighborhoods were overcrowded and lacked necessary infrastructure and social services. As a result of this alternate form of discrimination, African American women built the necessary and permanent institutions to strengthen their community. This included churches, schools, community centers, and mutual aid organizations. These social centers did a lot more than just providing necessary services. They united neighborhoods by allowing them to meet and form connections around common interests which resulted in the formation of a close-knit community. Different families would discuss issues they were struggling with and mutually generate possible solutions in these social centers. Small interactions between families might seem insignificant, but multiply these small interactions across thousands of people and the result was an increase in overall community pride and unity.
